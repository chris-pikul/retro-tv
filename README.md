# Retro TV

This is a project inspired and using the wonderful [My90sTV](https://my90stv.com)
website by [@joeycato](https://twitter.com/joeycato). I just wanted to add a 
facelift to it and modernize the code base. It's the same thing otherwise. I
know, I know, the original has a great late-90s internet feel. But I felt like
the immersion was lost. Plus, I was bored.
